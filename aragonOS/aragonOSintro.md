AragonOS is the main framework that EVMcrispr has been tailored to interact with. Aragon DAOs are easily deployable and highly customizable govenance platforms that can be launched using the [Aragon Client](https://aragon.org/aragon-client) on Mainnet or on Gnosis Chain via [1hive's Aragon Deployment](https://aragon.1hive.org/#/)

This DAO structure allows a variety of native and custom apps to be plugged into the DAO using the system's `Kernel` and each apps permissions in relation to other apps is dictated by the `ACL` - If you want to go deep and learn more technicals of Aragon DAOs you can check out the [Aragon Developer documentation](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/getting-started)
