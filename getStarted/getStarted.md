[**EVMcrispr**](https://evm-crispr.blossom.software/) is a powerful tool that combines a command line interface with a Javascript library to interact with Aragon DAOs. With it, you can bundle many DAO operations into just one script, generating a singular transaction/vote.

The true beauty of EVMcrispr is that you don't need to be a pro developer in order to create complex and powerful EVMscripts for DAOs. There are in fact only two requirements to start using this tool:

1. A modern web browser installed. (We recommend Brave)
2. A crypto web wallet extension installed on said modern browser. (like MetaMask)

That being said in order to fully grasp the utilities of EVMcrispr you should have some interediate knowledge of Ethereum, Javascript and navigating Block Explorers such as [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) for example.


## Using EVMcrispr

The most typical applications of EVMcrispr will be to create mutli-action scripts that can be sent to DAOs to be voted on. EVMcrispr in it's current form is tailor made to work within the AragonOS framework, navigating it's library of native and custom apps and permissions system.
